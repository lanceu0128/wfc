# wfc

Another Wave Function Collapse algorithm implementation in C++. My main goals are to get this (relatively) well-optimized sequentially, and then get it running concurrently with a GPU using CUDA. Also, I want to have an easy to use API for other developers to use WFC easily in games or other purposes.
